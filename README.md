# Molecule Binding Constant Predictor

## Overview
The Molecule Binding Constant Predictor is a tool designed to predict the binding constants of molecules using their SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) codes. The binding constant is a crucial parameter in molecular chemistry, indicating the strength of the interaction between two molecules. This tool leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions based on the input SMILES codes.

## Features
- **SMILES Code Input:** Easily input molecular structures using SMILES notation.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for accurate binding constant predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- Required Python packages 
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - rdkit
